A **Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor** is an advanced, feature-rich web application designed to enhance productivity by enabling multiple users to create, view, and edit documents together in real-time. This app replicates the core functionality of platforms like Google Docs but provides a lightweight and customizable solution for teams, students, and professionals. 

The frontend is developed using **React.js**, delivering a smooth and responsive user interface, while the backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js** for robust server-side logic. **Socket.IO** is used to establish real-time bidirectional communication between users, ensuring that every keystroke or formatting change is instantly reflected for all collaborators. This live collaboration experience significantly improves workflow, especially in academic, corporate, or remote working environments.

The app also includes intelligent document handling, automatic saving, and unique document ID routing for easy sharing. Whether you're drafting reports, notes, or letters, this tool empowers users to collaborate from anywhere — seamlessly and securely.
